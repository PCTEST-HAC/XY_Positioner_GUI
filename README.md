# Robotic Positioning Controller

This project was designed to allow easier use of the Arrick C4 Motor
controllers and generate contour plots based on measurement data. The
code is compatible with Python 2.7.x and was originally written in
Python 2.7.14

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo


## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

It is recommended that you install an IDE for viewing and running Python files. PyCharm is recommended as it does not require admin privileges. 
Spyder should also work and it comes preinstalled with Anaconda. Future versions should include a Jupyter Notebook to make data management testing easier.
